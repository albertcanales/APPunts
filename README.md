Who wouldn't want the best notes for their degree or get rewards for doing them?
With APPunts, you can have both of them!

## Inspiration
During our years in college, we have really missed a reliable platform where students could share their notes. That motivated us to develop such a platform.
## What it does
APPunts is a mobile app where students can post their notes from their curses or find them. You can also save your favorite notes to find them easier.
## How we built it
We used Android-Studio for our IDE. The back-end is made on Java and the front-end on XML. We distributed the tasks between two groups, each one more focused in one the areas above. 
## Challenges we ran into
Most of us had never programmed a mobile app before, so we had to learn on the spot. However, with some help turned out pretty well, and each of us could work on their tasks. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very happy of our workflow as a group, getting together to discuss features and problems was very fun and fullfilling.
Moreover, we believe that all that work has payed off, as we have achieved a pretty complete platform.
## What we learned
As most of us were new, we had to learn a lot, very fast. 
Also, it was our first time on working simultaneously on git, and although we were a bit lost at the begginging we could manage to used it properly.
## What's next for APPunts
The natural following step is its implementation with a built-in infraestructure, and implementing on real data all of the ideas embodied in the aplication.
